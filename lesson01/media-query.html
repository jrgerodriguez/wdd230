            <p>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write
                according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission
                of their sins.</p>

            <h2>1 Nephi 15:14</h2>
            <p>And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they
                are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their
                forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their
                fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his
                doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.</p>
